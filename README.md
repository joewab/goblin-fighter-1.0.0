# Goblin Fighter V1

This is an application you can use to pit two monsters from DnD 5e against each other and see who wins!

The winner is determined by virtual dice rolls based on the creatures' actual stats.

The monster stats are sourced from [DnD 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)

The descriptions of the stages of battle are generated by OpenAI based on dynamically created prompts.

It is currently deployed on AWS Amplify [here](https://main.d3szxkwtdtrx3s.amplifyapp.com/)
